			<p>Welcome to my Willamette web page! Here you can find my resume and a little bit of information about some projects I have worked on.</p>
            <p>To download a PDF version of my resume, please <a href="http://willamette.edu/~afisher/ashley_fisher_resume.pdf">click here</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Senior Project: SRPG</b></p>
            <p>For my senior project in Computer Science, I am creating a grid-based Strategy Roleplaying Game. It is currently unfinished, but if you'd like to check it out you can head to the <a href="https://github.com/afisher/srpg">Github page</a>.</p>

            <p><b>npcworld</b></p>
            <p>npcworld was a group project I worked on for my Machine Learning class. It simulates organisms in an environment that eat, sleep, and breed, creating new organisms by means of a genetic algorithm. The project page is <a href="https://github.com/afisher/npcworld">here</a>.</p>

            <p><b>3D Game of Life</b></p>
            <p>This is a 3D implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> written in Java using OpenGL. Each cell is a cube in the grid, and is colored based on how many steps through the game it has survived.</p>

            <p><b>Spiral of Death</b></p>
            <p>This was a 2D game I wrote in high school with <a href="http://willamette.edu/~bmock">Brian Mock</a>. It was written in Python using <a href="http://pygame.org">Pygame</a>. It is a 2-player game in which player shoot projectiles into a spiral of enemies. The player who shoots the most enemies wins the game. The projectiles had gravity applied to them. We created the graphics for the game ourselves in <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Python Tutorial</b></p>
            <p>As a project during my senior year of high school, I took up learning Python and wrote a tutorial for other students to use. I also taught a workshop at my school's technology conference on coding in Python. You can download the tutorial <a href="python_tutorial.pdf">here</a>.
