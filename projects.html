            <p>Here you can check out some of the more interesting projects I have worked on as a computer science student.</p>
            <p><b>Pycross (working title)</b></p>
            <p>This is an open source clone of the puzzle game <i>Picross</i>, written in Python using <a href="http://pyglet.org">Pyglet</a>. It is currently in the early stages of development, but can be found on github <a href="https://github.com/afisher/pycross">here</a>.

            <p><b>3D Game of Life</b></p>
            <p>This is a 3D implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> written in Java using OpenGL. Each cell is a cube in the grid, and is colored based on how many steps through the game it has survived.</p>

            <p><b>Spiral of Death</b></p>
            <p>This was a 2D game I wrote in high school with <a href="http://willamette.edu/~bmock">Brian Mock</a>. It was written in Python using <a href="http://pygame.org">Pygame</a>. It is a 2-player game in which player shoot projectiles into a spiral of enemies. The player who shoots the most enemies wins the game. The projectiles had gravity applied to them. We created the graphics for the game ourselves in <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Python Tutorial</b></p>
            <p>As a project during my senior year of high school, I took up learning Python and wrote a tutorial for other students to use. I also taught a workshop at my school's technology conference on coding in Python. You can download the tutorial <a href="python_tutorial.pdf">here</a>.
